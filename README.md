## About the Project
The objective of this **project** is to identify young soccer players who posses the potential to become **the next Kylian Mbappé**. This project was completed in 5 days in collaboration with my fellow Ironhack classmates, [Nati](https://github.com/natnaelfe) & [Hugo](https://github.com/HugoIronhack).

## About the Dataset
After reading the [documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ekrembayar/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset?select=fifa21_male2.csv) we decided to proceed with the following **strategy**:

1. The majority of the data types are **numericals**, so we will work with that to make a Linear Regression model.
2. The **target** for our dataset it will be the `OVA` (overall score) of a player.
3. Through **Exploratory Data Analysis** we will identify the features that contribute to this prediction.

## Results and Discussion
* R2 =  0.9803855414655414
* RMSE =  0.9587213732027325
* The value of the metric MSE is  0.9191466714357331
* MAE =  0.7269314203992508
